  abstract = {This paper presents a computational procedure designed to derive a
	regional model of the low temperature geothermal potential and its
	economic exploitability. The model was applied to the Italian Marche
	region and developed with the support of a Geographic Information
	System (GIS), which highlights the spatial dependencies in the distribution
	of geothermic resources. The Low Temperature Geothermal Energy has
	already gained attention as a renewable energy resource for domestic
	heating and represents a growing opportunity for investment. Although
	it is common practice to conduct an accurate evaluation of the geothermal
	potential and its exploitability on a site during the construction
	of a single installation, there is not an established practice or
	guidelines for estimating this resource over large territories. This
	information could support an institution’s ability to conduct regional
	energy planning and guide private entrepreneurship to meet new economic
	opportunities. To address these issues, the main contribution of
	this work is a model that reduces the distance between the physical
	knowledge of the territory/environment and economic analysis. The
	model is based on a useful assessment of low temperature geothermal
	potential obtained from physical parameters on a regional scale,
	from which a set of economic indicators are calculated to evaluate
	the actual economic accessibility to the geothermal energy resource.},

  abstract = {Web services are currently one of the trends in network-based business
	services, which intuitively will be applied to build a semantic web-based
	decision support system (DSS). Since web services are self-contained,
	modular business process applications, based on open standards, enable
	integration models for facilitating program-to-program interactions.
	Decision modules in a semantic web-based DSS can be viewed as a web
	service. However, according to the current features, web services
	know only about themselves, they are neither autonomous, nor are
	they designed to use ontologies; they are passive until invoked,
	and they do not provide for composing functionalities. These lead
	to the motivation on building a sophisticated web service to contain
	these features and to utilize web services on behalf of the user.
	This paper aims to propose a new concept of Meta Web Service, a web
	service-based DSS. The meta web service understands the user's problem
	statement with ontology, performs web service discovery, web service
	composition, and automatically generates codes for composite web
	service execution. Case-based reasoning is applied to quickly find
	past histories of successful service compositions. A prototype of
	research web service has been developed to show the feasibility of
	the proposed idea.},

	integration among all members of organizational supply networks without

	agent technology with web services to make use of the advantages
	from both, this approach leads to more intelligence, flexibility

	of this approach is evaluated through a use case and demonstration

  journal = {Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {31(4)},
  pages = {517-537},
  abstract = {Urban planners need to have a flexible, interactive, and intelligent
	computer-based tool to support their use of analytical models and
	to structure their planning process. Existing spatial information
	systems have not developed appropriate procedures and mechanisms
	to enable easy construction and manipulation of models within their
	system environment, and to allow various information resources to
	be shared by different application systems and platforms. Recent
	research and development of planning support systems (PSS) provide
	a range of interesting concepts and frameworks that can be adopted
	by system developers to design a multifunctional and planning-specific
	decision support system to meet the multifaceted needs of the planning
	process. In this paper we aim to go beyond the current approaches
	of PSS and spatial decision support systems (SDSS) in designing a
	knowledge-based PSS (KBPSS) that uses the component-based software
	development (CBSD) approach. We introduce the features of CBSD and
	its technical advantages in the design of a multifunctional PSS.
	An architecture of a component-based KBPSS is subsequently proposed
	which incorporates four essential component systems: MapObjects GIS,
	Database Manager database management system, ModelObjects model-management
	system, and KBSAgents knowledge-based system. The first two components
	are based on proprietary components systems and can be easily adapted
	into the KBPSS environment. The ModelObjects and KBSAgents components
	were developed by the authors. Based on these components and their
	associated information layers, two application subsystems are constructed:
	a Model and Knowledge Development System and an Intelligent Model
	Selection System. These application systems can be used to assist
	users and model developers to build new models or to select predefined
	models from an existing model library for their problems. In order
	to implement these functions, we propose and define a number of procedures
	and techniques for component communication and model and knowledge
	development.},

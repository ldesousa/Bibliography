  Abstract                 = {A coordinate system is described which provides a natural means for representing hexagonally-organized pixels. The coordinate system has the unusual property that its basis vectors are not orthogonal. Vector-space properties and operations are described in this coordinate system, and shown to be straightforward computations. Some image processing algorithms, including calculations of image gradients and variable-conductance diffusion, are expressed and analyzed.},

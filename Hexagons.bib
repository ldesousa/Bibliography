The coordinate system has the unusual property that its basis vectors are not orthogonal. Vector-space properties and operations are described in this coordinate system, and shown to be straightforward computations. Some image processing algorithms, including calculations of image gradients and variable-conductance diffusion, are expressed and analyzed.},

  Abstract                 = {In encoding, simplifying, amalgamating and intersecting cartographic features, it is useful to know the precision of locational data being processed. It is suggested that representing spatial phenomena in a hierarchical tessellated framework can facilitate documenting the certainty of coordinates and in dealing with its consequences. Objects thus encoded can identify the precision with which they were measured, and can retrieved at lower degrees of precision, as appropriate. This scale sensitivity is an inherent aspect of quadtree and pyramid data structures, and one which the literature on GIS data quality has yet to address in detail. A specific hierarchical tessellation of the sphere into triangular facets is proposed as a basis for indexing planetary data; Although composed of triangular facets, the tessellation is a quadtree hierarchy. Its geometry is such that that its facets are planar, subdivide a sphere naturally and are efficient to address. Methods for generating and manipulating hierarchical planetary geocodes are described.},
  Review                   = {. Sphere tesselated into triangular facets

. Quadtrees are not able to provide a hierarchical tesselation of the sphere in a consistent manner

 - 1, 4, 16, 64, 256 ...
 - 8, 32, 128, 512, 2048 ...

. Model is called Quaternary Triangular Mesh (QTM)

. QTM can be used for geocoding.

. geocode - hierachical address of a location on the planet

. QTM defines three interlocking triangular grids of hexagons, covering 75% of the planet, with triangles covering the other 25%.

. QTM addresses can replace coordinates in a georeferenced database

. Trilocation => derivation of facet addresses (geocodes) from geographic coordinates (Dutton 1984a).

"It is generally assumed that coordinates exist in nature, when in fact they are rather artificial notations for spatial phenomena. Features in a GIS do not actually have coordinates, coordinates are in fact ascribed to them..."

  Abstract                 = {In many mathematical models for pattern formation, a regular hexagonal pattern is stable in an infinite region. However, laboratory and numerical experiments are carried out in finite domains, and this imposes constraints on the possible patterns. In finite rectangular domains, it is shown that a regular hexagonal pattern cannot occur if the aspect ratio is rational. In practice, it is found experimentally that in a rectangular region, patterns of distorted hexagons are often observed. This work analyses the geometry and dynamics of distorted hexagonal patterns. These patterns occur in two different types, either with a reflection symmetry, involving two wave numbers, or without symmetry, involving three different wave numbers. The relevant amplitude equations are studied to determine the detailed bifurcation structure in each case. It is shown that hexagonal patterns can bifurcate subcritically either from the trivial solution or from a pattern of rolls. The transcritical bifurcation with D3 symmetry that occurs for regular hexagons unfolds into either two pitchfork bifurcations or two saddlenode bifurcations. Numerical simulations of a model partial differential equation are also presented to illustrate the behaviour.},

  Abstract                 = {Discrete global grid systems (DGGSs) represent a relatively new, but increasingly popular, approach to the problem of representing geospatial location on computer systems. Despite growing interest amongst potential users in icosahedral aperture 3 hexagon DGGSs, the practical use of such systems has been hindered by a lack of efficient spatial indexing methods. In this paper we discuss the two primary approaches to developing multi-resolution location coding systems for DGGSs: pyramid addressing and path addressing. We then describe an efficient pyramid addressing system for icosahedral aperture 3 hexagon DGGSs, the quadrilateral 2-dimensional integer system. After reviewing the problems inherent in developing path addressing systems for hexagon-based \{DGGSs\} we describe a class of path-based location coding solutions for icosahedral aperture 3 hexagon \{DGGSs\} called modified generalized balanced ternary, and show how this system can be used to index vector data. We then discuss a subset of this system, the icosahedral aperture 3 hexagon tree, which can be used to index raster and bucket data structures. Conversion algorithms to/from geodetic coordinates are discussed. },

. studies of Saff and Kuijlaars [14], Kimerling [15] and so
on prove that the advantages of hexagon girds can be extended
to sphere gird system. 

. Hexagonal Quad Balanced Structure (HQBT)

. Uses a double geometric partition of the hexagon that complement each other at the 3rd level

. This hierarchy is then quadtree 
 - each node has tree children 
 - there are gaps in top levels

. The space covered by the 3rd level system forms a triangle

. This triangle is then matched to a face of the icosahedron

. Relies on a lookup table for vector adition}

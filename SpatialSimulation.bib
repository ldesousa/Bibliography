  Abstract                 = {The modelling of processes that occur in landscapes is often confronted to issues related to the represen- tation of space and the difficulty of properly handling time and multiple scales. In order to investigate these issues, a flexible modelling environment is required. We propose to develop such a tool based on a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that capitalises on the service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm. The modelling framework around the DSL is composed of a model building environment, a code genera- tor and compiler, and a program execution platform. The DSL introduces five language elements (entity, service, relation, scenario and datafacer) that can be combined to offer a wide range of possibilities for modelling in space and time at different scales. When developing a model, model parts are either built using the DSL or taken from libraries of previously built ones, and adapted to the specific model. The practical usage of the DSL is illustrated first with the Lotka–Volterra model, and then with a landscape modelling experiment on the spread of a mosquito-borne disease in the Sahelian region of West Africa. An interesting characteristic of this approach is the possibility of adding new elements into an existing model, and replacing others with more appropriate ones, thus allowing potentially complex models to be built from simpler parts. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A DSL for service-based landscape dynamics models . 5 main concepts: - entity: a model component that can be composed into other entities; provides services - service: comunication port of an entity, it takes arguments and returns results - relation: bonds enetities through their services (compatible interfaces, see below) - scenario: gives a description of which actions and relations within a composite entity have to be activated, and when; can composed of several scenarios - datafacer: a device through which entities access data; contains the necessary functions, developed for specific types of data sources; it is an atomic entity . Other concepts: - selection: set of entities with compatible services - interface: set of services - action: something that can affect other entities (creation, desctruction, modification) - operation: service call, arithmetic instruction, etc... . The concept of agent or automaton is not explicit . Eclipse plug-ins for model development and code generation . Datafacer => inter-operability . Produces Java classes => portability . "Landscape elements are modelled as entities, which in turn can contain other landscape elements (entities). Interactions between landscape ele- ments are modelled using relations". .

  Abstract                 = {The Agent Modeling Language (AML) is a semi-formal visual modeling language for specifying, mod- eling and documenting systems that incorporate features drawn from multi-agent systems theory. It is specified as an extension to UML 2.0 in accordance with major OMG modeling frameworks (MDA, MOF, UML, and OCL). The ultimate objective of AML is to provide software engineers with a ready-to-use, complete and highly expressive modeling language suitable for the development of commercial software solutions based on multi-agent technologies. This paper presents an overview of AML. The scope of the language, its structure and extensibility mechanisms are discussed, and the core AML modeling constructs and mechanisms are introduced and demonstrated by examples.},
  Review                   = {. More geared to AI and Social interactions: socail dynamics, social behaviour, social atitude . It makes extensive usage of the UML language: defining specialized classes, associations and properties. . Semi-entity types are specialized UML classes used to specify coherent set of features. 2 types: - Behaviored semi-entities represent elements, which can own capabilities, observe and/or effect their environment by means of perceptors and effectors, provide and use services - Socialized semi-entities represent elements, which can form societies, can participate in social relationships and can own social properties. . Entities that compose MASs are: - agents: self contained entities that are capable of interactions, observations and autonomous behavior within their environment; - resources: physical or informational entities with which the main concern is their availability; - environments: logical or physical surroundings of entities which provide conditions under which the entities exist and function. . Behavioured Semi-entities: Agent, Resource, Environment . Socialized semi-entities: . Social aspects (usual in MAS): - social structure: identification of societies - social behaviour: the way a society reacts as a whole to events - social attitude: individual motivations . Social concepts (structure and function): - Organisation Units: a special type of environment - Social Relationships: a specialised association - Entity Roles: a semi-entity type used to model abstractions of a coherent set of (atomic?) features - Role properties: determines the ability of an entity to play a role . UML extensions for interaction: - extensions to generic UML interactions: used for communication, scheduling, state changes, etc - speech act interactions: communication - observations and effecting interactions: models perception and reactions to related entities' states - services: funcionality provided by an entity}

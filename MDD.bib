  Abstract                 = {The term Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is typically used to describe software development approaches in which abstract models of software systems are created and system- atically transformed to concrete implementations. In this paper we give an overview of current research in MDE and discuss some of the major challenges that must be tackled in order to realize the MDE vision of software development. We argue that full realizations of the MDE vision may not be possible in the near to medium-term primarily because of the wicked problems involved. On the other hand, at- tempting to realize the vision will provide insights that can be used to significantly reduce the gap between evolving software complexity and the technologies used to manage complexity.},

  Abstract                 = {There have been few experience reports from industry on how Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is applied and what the benefits are. This paper summarizes the experiences of three large industrial participants in a European research project with the objective of developing techniques and tools for applying MDE on the development of large and complex software systems. The participants had varying degrees of previous experience with MDE. They found MDE to be particularly useful for providing abstractions of complex systems at multiple levels or from different viewpoints, for the development of domain-specific models that facilitate communication with non-technical experts, for the purposes of simulation and testing, and for the consumption of models for analysis, such as performance-related decision support and system design improvements. From the industrial perspective, a methodology is considered to be useful and cost-efficient if it is possible to reuse solutions in multiple projects or products. However, developing reusable solutions required extra effort and sometimes had a negative impact on the performance of tools. While the companies identified several benefits of MDE, merging different tools with one another in a seamless development environment required several transformations, which increased the required implementation effort and complexity. Additionally, user-friendliness of tools and the provision of features for managing models of complex systems were identified as crucial for a wider industrial adoption of MDE.},

  Abstract                 = {Tools to support modelling in system and software engineering are widespread, and have reached a degree of maturity where their use and availability are accepted. Tools to support model-driven development (MDD)- where models are manipulated and managed throughout the system/software engineering lifecycle - have, over the last 10 years, seen much research and development attention. Over the last 10 years, we have had significant experience in the design, development and deployment of MDD tools in practical settings. In this paper, we distill some of the important lessons we have learned in developing and deploying two MDD tools: Epsilon and VIATRA. In doing so, we aim to identify some of the key principles of developing successful MDD tools, as well as some hints of the pitfalls and risks.},
